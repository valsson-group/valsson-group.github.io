## Enhanced Sampling Methods for Soft Matter Simulations

This group focuses on the development and application of classical and quantum molecular simulation techniques for studying soft matter and chemical systems. Considerable focus is on the development of novel enhanced sampling algorithms for studying the long timescale phenomena which are common in nature, but are normally inaccessible in conventional molecular simulations due to their intrinsic limitations and the limits of computational power.

The group is lead by [Dr. Omar Valsson]({{site.url}}/members/omar-valsson), a group leader within the [Theory Department](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/kremer) of Prof. Kurt Kremer at the [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/2785/en) in Mainz, Germany.
